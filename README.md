# Interactive 3D Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built using **HTML, CSS, and Three.js**.

## Features
- Clean, modern UI
- Interactive 3D object using Three.js
- Mouse-based interaction
- Responsive layout

## Why Three.js?
I built this project to understand:
- Real-time rendering on the web
- Camera perspective and lighting
- Animation loops using requestAnimationFrame
- Performance considerations in interactive UIs

## How to run
Simply open `index.html` in any modern browser.
